public interface BankOperations {
    int getBalance();
    void deposit(int amount);
    boolean withdraw(int amount);
}
The interface contains methods for getting the balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. The withdraw method returns a boolean value indicating whether the withdrawal was successful or not.

Next, let's create the BankAccount class which implements the BankOperations interface:

java
Copy code
public class BankAccount implements BankOperations {
    private int balance;

    public BankAccount(int initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    @Override
    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    @Override
    public void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean withdraw(int amount) {
        if (amount > balance) {
            return false;
        }
        balance -= amount;
        return true;
    }
}
The BankAccount class has an instance variable balance which represents the current balance in the bank account. The class implements the methods defined in the BankOperations interface for getting the balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

Now, let's create the BankingController class which acts as the controller in the MVC pattern:

csharp
Copy code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BankingController {
    private BankOperations bank;
    private Scanner scanner;

    public BankingController(BankOperations bank) {
        this.bank = bank;
        scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    }

    public void run() {
        boolean quit = false;
        while (!quit) {
            System.out.println("Welcome to MyBank");
            System.out.println("------------------");
            System.out.println("1. Check Balance");
            System.out.println("2. Deposit");
            System.out.println("3. Withdraw");
            System.out.println("4. Quit");
            System.out.print("Enter your choice: ");
            int choice = scanner.nextInt();
            switch (choice) {
                case 1:
                    System.out.println("Your balance is: " + bank.getBalance());
                    break;
                case 2:
                    System.out.print("Enter deposit amount: ");
                    int deposit = scanner.nextInt();
                    bank.deposit(deposit);
                    System.out.println("Deposit successful.");
                    break;
                case 3:
                    System.out.print("Enter withdrawal amount: ");
                    int withdrawal = scanner.nextInt();
                    boolean success = bank.withdraw(withdrawal);
                    if (success) {
                        System.out.println("Withdrawal successful.");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("Insufficient balance.");
                    }
                    break;
                case 4:
                    quit = true;
                    System.out.println("Thank you for using MyBank.");
                    break;
                default:
                    System.out.println("Invalid choice.");
            }
            System.out.println(); // Print a blank line for spacing
        }
    }
}
The BankingController class takes an instance of the BankOperations interface as a constructor parameter. It also has a Scanner object to read input from the console. The run method contains the main loop which displays the menu and processes the user's choice. It calls the appropriate methods on the bank object based on the user's choice.

Finally, let's create the Main class which acts as the view in the MVC pattern:

java
Copy code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankOperations bank = new BankAccount(0);
        BankingController controller = new BankingController(bank
